 Tape archives (tar) are a file format for storing a sequence of files that
 can be read and written in a streaming manner.
 This package aims to cover most variations of the format,
 including those produced by GNU and BSD tar tools.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 meet the following conditions:
 .
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files; and
 .
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 as modifying the License.
 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.
 .
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 <li>arm</li>
 </ul>
 More values may be supported in the future and any of these may or may
 not be supported by a given container runtime implementation.

 The name of the operating system which the image is built to run on.
 Possible values include:
 <ul>
 <li>darwin</li>

 <li>linux</li>
 </ul>
 More values may be supported in the future and any of these may or may
 not be supported by a given container runtime implementation.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 config <code>struct</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 The execution parameters which should be used as a base when running a
 container using the image. This field can be <code>null</code>, in
 which case any execution parameters should be specified at creation of
 the container.
 <h4>Container RunConfig Field Descriptions</h4>
 <dl>
 <dt>
 User <code>string</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The username or UID which the process in the container should
 run as. This acts as a default value to use when the value is
 not specified when creating a container.</p>
 <p>All of the following are valid:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><code>user</code></li>
 <li><code>uid</code></li>
 <li><code>user:group</code></li>
 <li><code>uid:gid</code></li>
 <li><code>uid:group</code></li>
 <li><code>user:gid</code></li>
 </ul>
 <p>If <code>group</code>/<code>gid</code> is not specified, the
 default group and supplementary groups of the given
 <code>user</code>/<code>uid</code> in <code>/etc/passwd</code>
 from the container are applied.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>
 Memory <code>integer</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 Memory limit (in bytes). This acts as a default value to use
 when the value is not specified when creating a container.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 MemorySwap <code>integer</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 Total memory usage (memory + swap); set to <code>-1</code> to
 disable swap. This acts as a default value to use when the
 value is not specified when creating a container.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 CpuShares <code>integer</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 CPU shares (relative weight vs. other containers). This acts as
 a default value to use when the value is not specified when
 creating a container.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 ExposedPorts <code>struct</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 A set of ports to expose from a container running this image.
 This JSON structure value is unusual because it is a direct
 JSON serialization of the Go type
 <code>map[string]struct{}</code> and is represented in JSON as
 an object mapping its keys to an empty object. Here is an
 example:
 <pre>{
 "8080": {},
 "53/udp": {},
 "2356/tcp": {}
 }</pre>
 Its keys can be in the format of:
 <ul>
 <li>
 <code>"port/tcp"</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>"port/udp"</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>"port"</code>
 </li>
 </ul>
 with the default protocol being <code>"tcp"</code> if not
 specified. These values act as defaults and are merged with any
 specified when creating a container.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 Env <code>array of strings</code>
 </dt>
 <dd>

 WARNING:  The plugin interface is currently EXPERIMENTAL and is subject to
 change.
 .
 protoc (aka the Protocol Compiler) can be extended via plugins.  A plugin is
 just a program that reads a CodeGeneratorRequest from stdin and writes a
 CodeGeneratorResponse to stdout.

 Plugins written using C++ can use google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.h instead
 of dealing with the raw protocol defined here.

 A plugin executable needs only to be placed somewhere in the path.  The
 plugin should be named "protoc-gen-$NAME", and will then be used when the

 Package mapset implements a simple and generic set collection.
 Items stored within it are unordered and unique. It supports
 typical set operations: membership testing, intersection, union,
 difference, symmetric difference and cloning.
 .
 Package mapset provides two implementations. The default
 implementation is safe for concurrent access. There is a non-threadsafe
 implementation which is slightly more performant.

 Package view contains support for collecting and exposing aggregates over stats.
 .
 In order to collect measurements, views need to be defined and registered.
 A view allows recorded measurements to be filtered and aggregated.
 .
 All recorded measurements can be grouped by a list of tags.
 .
 OpenCensus provides several aggregation methods: Count, Distribution and Sum.
 .
 Count only counts the number of measurement points recorded.
 Distribution provides statistical summary of the aggregated data by counting
 how many recorded measurements fall into each bucket.
 Sum adds up the measurement values.
 LastValue just keeps track of the most recently recorded measurement value.
 All aggregations are cumulative.
 .
 Views can be registered and unregistered at any time during program execution.
 .
 Libraries can define views but it is recommended that in most cases registering
 views be left up to applications.
 .
 Exporting
 .
 Collected and aggregated data can be exported to a metric collection
 backend by registering its exporter.
 .
 Multiple exporters can be registered to upload the data to various
 different back ends.

 Package metadata stores all labels and object specific metadata by namespace.
 This package also contains the main garbage collection logic  for cleaning up
 resources consistently and atomically. Resources used by backends will be
 tracked in the metadata store to be exposed to consumers of this package.
 .
 The layout where a "/" delineates a bucket is described in the following
 section. Please try to follow this as closely as possible when adding
 functionality. We can bolster this with helpers and more structure if that
 becomes an issue.
 .
 Generically, we try to do the following:
 .
 <version>/<namespace>/<object>/<key> -> <field>
 .
 version: Currently, this is "v1". Additions can be made to v1 in a backwards
 compatible way. If the layout changes, a new version must be made, along
 with a migration.
 .
 namespace: the namespace to which this object belongs.
 .
 object: defines which object set is stored in the bucket. There are two
 special objects, "labels" and "indexes". The "labels" bucket stores the
 labels for the parent namespace. The "indexes" object is reserved for
 indexing objects, if we require in the future.
 .
 key: object-specific key identifying the storage bucket for the objects
 contents.
 .
 Below is the current database schema. This should be updated each time
 the structure is changed in addition to adding a migration and incrementing
 the database version. Note that `╘══*...*` refers to maps with arbitrary
 keys.

 Package prometheus is the core instrumentation package. It provides metrics
 primitives to instrument code for monitoring. It also offers a registry for
 metrics. Sub-packages allow to expose the registered metrics via HTTP
 (package promhttp) or push them to a Pushgateway (package push). There is
 also a sub-package promauto, which provides metrics constructors with
 automatic registration.
 .
 All exported functions and methods are safe to be used concurrently unless
 specified otherwise.
 .
 A Basic Example
 .
 As a starting point, a very basic usage example:
 .
 package main
 .
 import (
 "log"
 "net/http"

 Package trace contains support for OpenCensus distributed tracing.
 .
 The following assumes a basic familiarity with OpenCensus concepts.
 See http://opencensus.io
 .
 Exporting Traces
 .
 To export collected tracing data, register at least one exporter. You can use
 one of the provided exporters or write your own.
 .
 trace.RegisterExporter(exporter)
 .
 By default, traces will be sampled relatively rarely. To change the sampling
 frequency for your entire program, call ApplyConfig. Use a ProbabilitySampler
 to sample a subset of traces, or use AlwaysSample to collect a trace on every run:
 .
 trace.ApplyConfig(trace.Config{DefaultSampler: trace.AlwaysSample()})
 .
 Be careful about using trace.AlwaysSample in a production application with
 significant traffic: a new trace will be started and exported for every request.
 .
 Adding Spans to a Trace
 .
 A trace consists of a tree of spans. In Go, the current span is carried in a
 context.Context.
 .
 It is common to want to capture all the activity of a function call in a span. For
 this to work, the function must take a context.Context as a parameter. Add these two
 lines to the top of the function:

 Package filters defines a syntax and parser that can be used for the
 filtration of items across the containerd API. The core is built on the
 concept of protobuf field paths, with quoting.  Several operators allow the
 user to flexibly select items based on field presence, equality, inequality
 and regular expressions. Flexible adaptors support working with any type.
 .
 The syntax is fairly familiar, if you've used container ecosystem
 projects.  At the core, we base it on the concept of protobuf field
 paths, augmenting with the ability to quote portions of the field path
 to match arbitrary labels. These "selectors" come in the following
 syntax:
 .
 ```
 <fieldpath>[<operator><value>]
 ```
 .
 A basic example is as follows:
 .
 ```

 Package stats contains support for OpenCensus stats recording.
 .
 OpenCensus allows users to create typed measures, record measurements,
 aggregate the collected data, and export the aggregated data.
 .
 Measures
 .
 A measure represents a type of data point to be tracked and recorded.
 For example, latency, request Mb/s, and response Mb/s are measures
 to collect from a server.
 .
 Measure constructors such as Int64 and Float64 automatically
 register the measure by the given name. Each registered measure needs
 to be unique by name. Measures also have a description and a unit.
 .
 Libraries can define and export measures. Application authors can then
 create views and collect and break down measures by the tags they are
 interested in.
 .
 Recording measurements
 .
 Measurement is a data point to be collected for a measure. For example,
 for a latency (ms) measure, 100 is a measurement that represents a 100ms
 latency event. Measurements are created from measures with
 the current context. Tags from the current context are recorded with the
 measurements if they are any.
 .
 Recorded measurements are dropped immediately if no views are registered for them.
 There is usually no need to conditionally enable and disable
 recording to reduce cost. Recording of measurements is cheap.
 .
 Libraries can always record measurements, and applications can later decide
 on which measurements they want to collect by registering views. This allows
 libraries to turn on the instrumentation by default.
 .
 Exemplars
 .
 For a given recorded measurement, the associated exemplar is a diagnostic map
 that gives more information about the measurement.
 .
 When aggregated using a Distribution aggregation, an exemplar is kept for each
 bucket in the Distribution. This allows you to easily find an example of a
 measurement that fell into each bucket.
 .
 For example, if you also use the OpenCensus trace package and you
 record a measurement with a context that contains a sampled trace span,
 then the trace span will be added to the exemplar associated with the measurement.
 .
 When exported to a supporting back end, you should be able to easily navigate
 to example traces that fell into each bucket in the Distribution.

 Package status implements errors returned by gRPC.  These errors are
 serialized and transmitted on the wire between server and client, and allow
 for additional data to be transmitted via the Details field in the status
 proto.  gRPC service handlers should return an error created by this
 package, and gRPC clients should expect a corresponding error to be
 returned from the RPC call.
 .
 This package upholds the invariants that a non-nil error may not
 contain an OK code, and an OK code must result in a nil error.

 .
 Package cloud is the root of the packages used to access Google Cloud
 Services. See https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go for a full list
 of sub-packages.
 .
 Client Options
 .
 All clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These options are
 described here: https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/option.
 .
 Authentication and Authorization
 .
 All the clients in sub-packages support authentication via Google Application Default
 Credentials (see https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production), or
 by providing a JSON key file for a Service Account. See the authentication examples
 in this package for details.
 .
 Timeouts and Cancellation
 .
 By default, all requests in sub-packages will run indefinitely, retrying on transient
 errors when correctness allows. To set timeouts or arrange for cancellation, use
 contexts. See the examples for details.
 .
 Do not attempt to control the initial connection (dialing) of a service by setting a
 timeout on the context passed to NewClient. Dialing is non-blocking, so timeouts
 would be ineffective and would only interfere with credential refreshing, which uses
 the same context.
 .
 Connection Pooling
 .
 Connection pooling differs in clients based on their transport. Cloud
 clients either rely on HTTP or gRPC transports to communicate
 with Google Cloud.
 .
 Cloud clients that use HTTP (bigquery, compute, storage, and translate) rely on the
 underlying HTTP transport to cache connections for later re-use. These are cached to
 the default http.MaxIdleConns and http.MaxIdleConnsPerHost settings in
 http.DefaultTransport.
 .
 For gRPC clients (all others in this repo), connection pooling is configurable. Users
 of cloud client libraries may specify option.WithGRPCConnectionPool(n) as a client
 option to NewClient calls. This configures the underlying gRPC connections to be
 pooled and addressed in a round robin fashion.
 .
 Using the Libraries with Docker
 .
 Minimal docker images like Alpine lack CA certificates. This causes RPCs to appear to
 hang, because gRPC retries indefinitely. See https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/928
 for more information.

 Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message
 digests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is
 designed to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.
 More importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with
 hash.Hash-based digests with little effort.
 .
 Basics
 .
 The format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the
 "algorithm" and the "digest", separated by a colon:
 .
 <algorithm>:<digest>
 .
 An example of a sha256 digest representation follows:
 .
 sha256:7173b809ca12ec5dee4506cd86be934c4596dd234ee82c0662eac04a8c2c71dc
 .
 The "algorithm" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate
 the digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to "hex"
 if not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their
 digests encoded in hex strings.
 .
 In the example above, the string "sha256" is the algorithm and the hex bytes
 are the "digest".
 .
 Because the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is
 obtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the
 standard equality operator.
 .
 Verification
 .
 The main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a
 given digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash
 interface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After
 writing is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate
 whether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.
 .
 Missing Features
 .
 In addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this
 package:
 .
 1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.
 .
 2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.

 This package exists to cause `go mod` and `go get` to believe these tools
 are dependencies, even though they are not runtime dependencies of any
 package (these are tools used by our CI builds). This means they will appear
 in our `go.mod` file, but will not be a part of the build. Also, since the
 build target is something non-existent, these should not be included in any
 binaries.

 Package logging is an auto-generated package for the
 Stackdriver Logging API.
 .
 NOTE: This package is in alpha. It is not stable, and is likely to change.
 .
 Writes log entries and manages your Logging configuration.
 .
 Use of Context
 .
 The ctx passed to NewClient is used for authentication requests and
 for creating the underlying connection, but is not used for subsequent calls.
 Individual methods on the client use the ctx given to them.
 .
 To close the open connection, use the Close() method.
 .
 For information about setting deadlines, reusing contexts, and more
 please visit godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go.
 .
 Use the client at cloud.google.com/go/logging in preference to this.

 Package promhttp provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients.
 .
 First, the package allows the creation of http.Handler instances to expose
 Prometheus metrics via HTTP. promhttp.Handler acts on the
 prometheus.DefaultGatherer. With HandlerFor, you can create a handler for a
 custom registry or anything that implements the Gatherer interface. It also
 allows the creation of handlers that act differently on errors or allow to
 log errors.
 .
 Second, the package provides tooling to instrument instances of http.Handler
 via middleware. Middleware wrappers follow the naming scheme
 InstrumentHandlerX, where X describes the intended use of the middleware.
 See each function's doc comment for specific details.
 .
 Finally, the package allows for an http.RoundTripper to be instrumented via
 middleware. Middleware wrappers follow the naming scheme
 InstrumentRoundTripperX, where X describes the intended use of the
 middleware. See each function's doc comment for specific details.

 Package bundler supports bundling (batching) of items. Bundling amortizes an
 action with fixed costs over multiple items. For example, if an API provides
 an RPC that accepts a list of items as input, but clients would prefer
 adding items one at a time, then a Bundler can accept individual items from
 the client and bundle many of them into a single RPC.

 This package is experimental and subject to change without notice.

 API/gRPC features intentionally missing from this client:
 - You cannot have the server pick the time of the entry. This client
 always sends a time.
 - There is no way to provide a protocol buffer payload.
 - No support for the "partial success" feature when writing log entries.
 .
 TODO(jba): test whether forward-slash characters in the log ID must be URL-encoded.
 These features are missing now, but will likely be added:
 - There is no way to specify CallOptions.

 Package gax contains a set of modules which aid the development of APIs
 for clients and servers based on gRPC and Google API conventions.
 .
 Application code will rarely need to use this library directly.
 However, code generated automatically from API definition files can use it
 to simplify code generation and to provide more convenient and idiomatic API surfaces.

 High Performance, Feature-Rich Idiomatic Go encoding library for msgpack and binc .
 .
 Supported Serialization formats are:
 .
 - msgpack: [https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack]
 - binc: [http://github.com/ugorji/binc]
 .
 To install:
 .
 go get github.com/ugorji/go/codec
 .
 The idiomatic Go support is as seen in other encoding packages in
 the standard library (ie json, xml, gob, etc).
 .
 Rich Feature Set includes:
 .
 - Simple but extremely powerful and feature-rich API
 - Very High Performance.
 Our extensive benchmarks show us outperforming Gob, Json and Bson by 2-4X.
 This was achieved by taking extreme care on:
 - managing allocation
 - function frame size (important due to Go's use of split stacks),
 - reflection use (and by-passing reflection for common types)
 - recursion implications
 - zero-copy mode (encoding/decoding to byte slice without using temp buffers)
 - Correct.
 Care was taken to precisely handle corner cases like:
 overflows, nil maps and slices, nil value in stream, etc.
 - Efficient zero-copying into temporary byte buffers
 when encoding into or decoding from a byte slice.
 - Standard field renaming via tags
 - Encoding from any value
 (struct, slice, map, primitives, pointers, interface{}, etc)
 - Decoding into pointer to any non-nil typed value
 (struct, slice, map, int, float32, bool, string, reflect.Value, etc)
 - Supports extension functions to handle the encode/decode of custom types
 - Support Go 1.2 encoding.BinaryMarshaler/BinaryUnmarshaler
 - Schema-less decoding
 (decode into a pointer to a nil interface{} as opposed to a typed non-nil value).
 Includes Options to configure what specific map or slice type to use
 when decoding an encoded list or map into a nil interface{}
 - Provides a RPC Server and Client Codec for net/rpc communication protocol.
 - Msgpack Specific:
 - Provides extension functions to handle spec-defined extensions (binary, timestamp)
 - Options to resolve ambiguities in handling raw bytes (as string or []byte)
 during schema-less decoding (decoding into a nil interface{})
 - RPC Server/Client Codec for msgpack-rpc protocol defined at:
 https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md
 - Fast Paths for some container types:
 For some container types, we circumvent reflection and its associated overhead
 and allocation costs, and encode/decode directly. These types are:
 []interface{}
 []int
 []string
 map[interface{}]interface{}
 map[int]interface{}
 map[string]interface{}
 .
 Extension Support
 .
 Users can register a function to handle the encoding or decoding of
 their custom types.
 .
 There are no restrictions on what the custom type can be. Some examples:
 .
 type BisSet   []int
 type BitSet64 uint64
 type UUID     string
 type MyStructWithUnexportedFields struct { a int; b bool; c []int; }
 type GifImage struct { ... }
 .
 As an illustration, MyStructWithUnexportedFields would normally be
 encoded as an empty map because it has no exported fields, while UUID
 would be encoded as a string. However, with extension support, you can
 encode any of these however you like.
 .
 RPC
 .
 RPC Client and Server Codecs are implemented, so the codecs can be used
 with the standard net/rpc package.
 .
 Usage
 .
 Typical usage model:
 .
 // create and configure Handle
 var (
 bh codec.BincHandle
 mh codec.MsgpackHandle
 )

 Package sign signs small messages using public-key cryptography.
 .
 Sign uses Ed25519 to sign messages. The length of messages is not hidden.
 Messages should be small because:
 1. The whole message needs to be held in memory to be processed.
 2. Using large messages pressures implementations on small machines to process
 plaintext without verifying the signature. This is very dangerous, and this API
 discourages it, but a protocol that uses excessive message sizes might present
 some implementations with no other choice.
 3. Performance may be improved by working with messages that fit into data caches.
 Thus large amounts of data should be chunked so that each message is small.
 .
 This package is not interoperable with the current release of NaCl
 (https://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html), which does not support Ed25519 yet. However,
 it is compatible with the NaCl fork libsodium (https://www.libsodium.org), as well
 as TweetNaCl (https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/).

 Package ipv4 implements IP-level socket options for the Internet
 Protocol version 4.
 .
 The package provides IP-level socket options that allow
 manipulation of IPv4 facilities.
 .
 The IPv4 protocol and basic host requirements for IPv4 are defined
 in RFC 791 and RFC 1122.
 Host extensions for multicasting and socket interface extensions
 for multicast source filters are defined in RFC 1112 and RFC 3678.
 IGMPv1, IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 are defined in RFC 1112, RFC 2236 and RFC
 3376.
 Source-specific multicast is defined in RFC 4607.
 .
 Unicasting
 .
 The options for unicasting are available for net.TCPConn,
 net.UDPConn and net.IPConn which are created as network connections
 that use the IPv4 transport. When a single TCP connection carrying
 a data flow of multiple packets needs to indicate the flow is
 important, Conn is used to set the type-of-service field on the
 IPv4 header for each packet.

 Package cryptobyte contains types that help with parsing and constructing
 length-prefixed, binary messages, including ASN.1 DER. (The asn1 subpackage
 contains useful ASN.1 constants.)
 .
 The String type is for parsing. It wraps a []byte slice and provides helper
 functions for consuming structures, value by value.
 .
 The Builder type is for constructing messages. It providers helper functions
 for appending values and also for appending length-prefixed submessages –
 without having to worry about calculating the length prefix ahead of time.
 .
 See the documentation and examples for the Builder and String types to get
 started.

 Package unix contains an interface to the low-level operating system
 primitives. OS details vary depending on the underlying system, and
 by default, godoc will display OS-specific documentation for the current
 system. If you want godoc to display OS documentation for another
 system, set $GOOS and $GOARCH to the desired system. For example, if
 you want to view documentation for freebsd/arm on linux/amd64, set $GOOS
 to freebsd and $GOARCH to arm.
 .
 The primary use of this package is inside other packages that provide a more
 portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".  Use
 those packages rather than this one if you can.
 .
 For details of the functions and data types in this package consult

 Package snappy implements the Snappy compression format. It aims for very
 high speeds and reasonable compression.
 .
 There are actually two Snappy formats: block and stream. They are related,
 but different: trying to decompress block-compressed data as a Snappy stream
 will fail, and vice versa. The block format is the Decode and Encode
 functions and the stream format is the Reader and Writer types.
 .
 The block format, the more common case, is used when the complete size (the
 number of bytes) of the original data is known upfront, at the time
 compression starts. The stream format, also known as the framing format, is
 for when that isn't always true.
 .
 The canonical, C++ implementation is at https://github.com/google/snappy and
 it only implements the block format.

 Package google provides support for making OAuth2 authorized and authenticated
 HTTP requests to Google APIs. It supports the Web server flow, client-side
 credentials, service accounts, Google Compute Engine service accounts, and Google
 App Engine service accounts.
 .
 A brief overview of the package follows. For more information, please read
 https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2
 and
 https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials.
 .
 OAuth2 Configs
 .
 Two functions in this package return golang.org/x/oauth2.Config values from Google credential
 data. Google supports two JSON formats for OAuth2 credentials: one is handled by ConfigFromJSON,
 the other by JWTConfigFromJSON. The returned Config can be used to obtain a TokenSource or
 create an http.Client.
 .
 Credentials
 .
 The Credentials type represents Google credentials, including Application Default
 Credentials.
 .
 Use FindDefaultCredentials to obtain Application Default Credentials.
 FindDefaultCredentials looks in some well-known places for a credentials file, and
 will call AppEngineTokenSource or ComputeTokenSource as needed.
 .
 DefaultClient and DefaultTokenSource are convenience methods. They first call FindDefaultCredentials,
 then use the credentials to construct an http.Client or an oauth2.TokenSource.
 .
 Use CredentialsFromJSON to obtain credentials from either of the two JSON formats
 described in OAuth2 Configs, above. The TokenSource in the returned value is the
 same as the one obtained from the oauth2.Config returned from ConfigFromJSON or
 JWTConfigFromJSON, but the Credentials may contain additional information
 that is useful is some circumstances.

 Package execabs is a drop-in replacement for os/exec
 that requires PATH lookups to find absolute paths.
 That is, execabs.Command("cmd") runs the same PATH lookup
 as exec.Command("cmd"), but if the result is a path
 which is relative, the Run and Start methods will report
 an error instead of running the executable.

 Package diff implements an algorithm for producing edit-scripts.
 The edit-script is a sequence of operations needed to transform one list
 of symbols into another (or vice-versa). The edits allowed are insertions,
 deletions, and modifications. The summation of all edits is called the
 Levenshtein distance as this problem is well-known in computer science.
 .
 This package prioritizes performance over accuracy. That is, the run time
 is more important than obtaining a minimal Levenshtein distance.

 Package pbkdf2 implements the key derivation function PBKDF2 as defined in RFC
 2898 / PKCS #5 v2.0.
 .
 A key derivation function is useful when encrypting data based on a password
 or any other not-fully-random data. It uses a pseudorandom function to derive
 a secure encryption key based on the password.
 .
 While v2.0 of the standard defines only one pseudorandom function to use,
 HMAC-SHA1, the drafted v2.1 specification allows use of all five FIPS Approved
 Hash Functions SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 for HMAC. To
 choose, you can pass the `New` functions from the different SHA packages to
 pbkdf2.Key.

 # Go support for Protocol Buffers
 .
 Google's data interchange format.
 Copyright 2010 The Go Authors.
 https://github.com/golang/protobuf
 .
 This package and the code it generates requires at least Go 1.6.
 .
 This software implements Go bindings for protocol buffers.  For
 information about protocol buffers themselves, see
 https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
 .
 ## Installation ##
 .
 To use this software, you must:
 - Install the standard C++ implementation of protocol buffers from
 https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
 - Of course, install the Go compiler and tools from
 https://golang.org/
 See
 https://golang.org/doc/install
 for details or, if you are using gccgo, follow the instructions at
 https://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo
 - Grab the code from the repository and install the `proto` package.
 The simplest way is to run `go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go`.
 The compiler plugin, `protoc-gen-go`, will be installed in `$GOPATH/bin`

 Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines,
 cancelation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries
 and between processes.
 As of Go 1.7 this package is available in the standard library under the
 name context.  https://golang.org/pkg/context.
 .
 Incoming requests to a server should create a Context, and outgoing calls to
 servers should accept a Context. The chain of function calls between must
 propagate the Context, optionally replacing it with a modified copy created
 using WithDeadline, WithTimeout, WithCancel, or WithValue.
 .
 Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces
 consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context
 propagation:
 .
 Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context
 explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the first
 parameter, typically named ctx:
 .
 func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
 // ... use ctx ...
 }
 .
 Do not pass a nil Context, even if a function permits it. Pass context.TODO
 if you are unsure about which Context to use.
 .
 Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and
 APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
 .
 The same Context may be passed to functions running in different goroutines;
 Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
 .
 See http://blog.golang.org/context for example code for a server that uses
 Contexts.

 This package and the code it generates requires at least Go 1.9.
 .
 This software implements Go bindings for protocol buffers.  For
 information about protocol buffers themselves, see
 https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
 .
 ## Installation ##
 .
 To use this software, you must:
 - Install the standard C++ implementation of protocol buffers from
 https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
 - Of course, install the Go compiler and tools from
 https://golang.org/
 See
 https://golang.org/doc/install
 for details or, if you are using gccgo, follow the instructions at
 https://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo
 - Grab the code from the repository and install the `proto` package.
 The simplest way is to run:
 ```
 go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
 ```
 The compiler plugin, `protoc-gen-go`, will be installed in `$GOPATH/bin`
 unless `$GOBIN` is set. It must be in your `$PATH` for the protocol
 compiler, `protoc`, to find it.
 - If you need a particular version of `protoc-gen-go` (e.g., to match your
 `proto` package version), one option is

 Package poly1305 implements Poly1305 one-time message authentication code as
 specified in https://cr.yp.to/mac/poly1305-20050329.pdf.
 .
 Poly1305 is a fast, one-time authentication function. It is infeasible for an
 attacker to generate an authenticator for a message without the key. However, a
 key must only be used for a single message. Authenticating two different
 messages with the same key allows an attacker to forge authenticators for other
 messages with the same key.
 .
 Poly1305 was originally coupled with AES in order to make Poly1305-AES. AES was
 used with a fixed key in order to generate one-time keys from an nonce.
 However, in this package AES isn't used and the one-time key is specified
 directly.

 Package cmp determines equality of values.
 .
 This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to
 reflect.DeepEqual for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.
 .
 The primary features of cmp are:
 .
 • When the default behavior of equality does not suit the needs of the test,
 custom equality functions can override the equality operation.
 For example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as they
 are within some tolerance of each other.
 .
 • Types that have an Equal method may use that method to determine equality.
 This allows package authors to determine the equality operation for the types
 that they define.
 .
 • If no custom equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined,
 equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both
 values, much like reflect.DeepEqual. Unlike reflect.DeepEqual, unexported
 fields are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed
 by using an Ignore option (see cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported) or explicitly compared
 using the AllowUnexported option.

 Package bpf implements marshaling and unmarshaling of programs for the
 Berkeley Packet Filter virtual machine, and provides a Go implementation
 of the virtual machine.
 .
 BPF's main use is to specify a packet filter for network taps, so that
 the kernel doesn't have to expensively copy every packet it sees to
 userspace. However, it's been repurposed to other areas where running
 user code in-kernel is needed. For example, Linux's seccomp uses BPF
 to apply security policies to system calls. For simplicity, this
 documentation refers only to packets, but other uses of BPF have their
 own data payloads.
 .
 BPF programs run in a restricted virtual machine. It has almost no
 access to kernel functions, and while conditional branches are
 allowed, they can only jump forwards, to guarantee that there are no
 infinite loops.
 .
 The virtual machine
 .
 The BPF VM is an accumulator machine. Its main register, called
 register A, is an implicit source and destination in all arithmetic
 and logic operations. The machine also has 16 scratch registers for
 temporary storage, and an indirection register (register X) for
 indirect memory access. All registers are 32 bits wide.
 .
 Each run of a BPF program is given one packet, which is placed in the
 VM's read-only "main memory". LoadAbsolute and LoadIndirect
 instructions can fetch up to 32 bits at a time into register A for
 examination.
 .
 The goal of a BPF program is to produce and return a verdict (uint32),
 which tells the kernel what to do with the packet. In the context of
 packet filtering, the returned value is the number of bytes of the
 packet to forward to userspace, or 0 to ignore the packet. Other
 contexts like seccomp define their own return values.
 .
 In order to simplify programs, attempts to read past the end of the
 packet terminate the program execution with a verdict of 0 (ignore
 packet). This means that the vast majority of BPF programs don't need
 to do any explicit bounds checking.
 .
 In addition to the bytes of the packet, some BPF programs have access
 to extensions, which are essentially calls to kernel utility
 functions. Currently, the only extensions supported by this package
 are the Linux packet filter extensions.
 .
 Examples
 .
 This packet filter selects all ARP packets.
 .
 bpf.Assemble([]bpf.Instruction{
 // Load "EtherType" field from the ethernet header.
 bpf.LoadAbsolute{Off: 12, Size: 2},
 // Skip over the next instruction if EtherType is not ARP.
 bpf.JumpIf{Cond: bpf.JumpNotEqual, Val: 0x0806, SkipTrue: 1},
 // Verdict is "send up to 4k of the packet to userspace."
 bpf.RetConstant{Val: 4096},
 // Verdict is "ignore packet."
 bpf.RetConstant{Val: 0},
 })
 .
 This packet filter captures a random 1% sample of traffic.
 .
 bpf.Assemble([]bpf.Instruction{
 // Get a 32-bit random number from the Linux kernel.
 bpf.LoadExtension{Num: bpf.ExtRand},

 .
 Package secretbox encrypts and authenticates small messages.
 .
 Secretbox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate messages with
 secret-key cryptography. The length of messages is not hidden.
 .
 It is the caller's responsibility to ensure the uniqueness of nonces—for
 example, by using nonce 1 for the first message, nonce 2 for the second
 message, etc. Nonces are long enough that randomly generated nonces have
 negligible risk of collision.
 .
 Messages should be small because:
 .
 1. The whole message needs to be held in memory to be processed.
 .
 2. Using large messages pressures implementations on small machines to decrypt
 and process plaintext before authenticating it. This is very dangerous, and
 this API does not allow it, but a protocol that uses excessive message sizes
 might present some implementations with no other choice.
 .
 3. Fixed overheads will be sufficiently amortised by messages as small as 8KB.
 .
 4. Performance may be improved by working with messages that fit into data caches.
 .
 Thus large amounts of data should be chunked so that each message is small.
 (Each message still needs a unique nonce.) If in doubt, 16KB is a reasonable
 chunk size.
 .
 This package is interoperable with NaCl: https://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html.

 +build windows
 .
 Package windows contains an interface to the low-level operating system
 primitives. OS details vary depending on the underlying system, and
 by default, godoc will display the OS-specific documentation for the current
 system. If you want godoc to display syscall documentation for another
 system, set $GOOS and $GOARCH to the desired system. For example, if
 you want to view documentation for freebsd/arm on linux/amd64, set $GOOS
 to freebsd and $GOARCH to arm.
 .
 The primary use of this package is inside other packages that provide a more
 portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".  Use
 those packages rather than this one if you can.
 .
 For details of the functions and data types in this package consult
 the manuals for the appropriate operating system.

 Package mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
 * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
 header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
 * URL hosts, paths and query values can have variables with an optional
 regular expression.
 * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
 references to resources.
 * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
 parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that
 share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated
 attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
 * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
 standard http.ServeMux.
 .
 Let's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:

 Package ed25519 implements the Ed25519 signature algorithm. See
 https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/.
 .
 These functions are also compatible with the “Ed25519” function defined in
 RFC 8032. However, unlike RFC 8032's formulation, this package's private key
 representation includes a public key suffix to make multiple signing
 operations with the same key more efficient. This package refers to the RFC
 8032 private key as the “seed”.
 .
 Beginning with Go 1.13, the functionality of this package was moved to the
 standard library as crypto/ed25519. This package only acts as a compatibility
 wrapper.

 - Has DCO
 - Contains sufficient justification (e.g., usecases) for the proposed change
 - References the GitHub issue it fixes (if any) in the commit or the first GitHub comment
 .
 Possible transitions from this state:
 .
 * Close: e.g., unresponsive contributor without DCO
 * `status/1-design-review`: general case
 * `status/2-code-review`: e.g. trivial bugfix
 * `status/3-docs-review`: non-proposal documentation-only change
 .
 ### Design review - `status/1-design-review`
 .
 Ideally, documentation should reflect the expected behavior of the code.  No code review should
 take place in this step.
 .
 There are no strict rules on the way a design is validated: we usually aim for a consensus,
 although a single maintainer approval is often sufficient for obviously reasonable changes. In
 general, strong disagreement expressed by any of the maintainers should not be taken lightly.
 .
 Once design is approved, a maintainer should make sure to remove this label and add the next one.
 .
 Possible transitions from this state:
 .
 * Close: design rejected
 * `status/2-code-review`: general case
 * `status/3-docs-review`: proposals with only documentation changes
 .
 ### Code review - `status/2-code-review`
 .
 New testcases are expected to be added. Ideally, those testcases should fail when the new code is
 absent, and pass when present. The testcases should strive to test as many variants, code paths, as
 possible to ensure maximum coverage.
 .
 Changes to code must be reviewed and approved (LGTM'd) by a minimum of two code maintainers. When
 the author of a PR is a maintainer, he still needs the approval of two other maintainers.
 .
 Once code is approved according to the rules of the subsystem, a maintainer should make sure to
 remove this label and add the next one. If documentation is absent but expected, maintainers should
 ask for documentation and move to status `status/3-docs-review` for docs maintainer to follow.
 .
 Possible transitions from this state:
 .
 * Close
 * `status/1-design-review`: new design concerns are raised
 * `status/3-docs-review`: general case
 * `status/4-ready-to-merge`: change not impacting documentation
 .
 ### Docs review - `status/3-docs-review`
 .
 They should ask for any editorial change that makes the documentation more consistent and easier to
 understand.

 ### Adding maintainers
 .
 The contributions alone don't make you a maintainer. You need to earn the
 trust of the current maintainers and other project contributors, that your
 decisions and actions are in the best interest of the project.
 .
 Periodically, the existing maintainers curate a list of contributors who have
 shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this
 list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed on the maintainers
 mailing list.
 .
 After a candidate is announced on the maintainers mailing list, the
 existing maintainers discuss the candidate over the next 5 business days,
 provide feedback, and vote. At least 66% of the current maintainers must
 vote in the affirmative.
 .
 If a candidate is approved, a maintainer contacts the candidate to
 invite them to open a pull request that adds the contributor to
 the MAINTAINERS file. The candidate becomes a maintainer once the pull
 request is merged.
 .
 ### Removing maintainers
 .
 #### How to step down
 .
 Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're a maintainer but
 feel you must remove yourself from the list, inform other maintainers that you
 intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work.
 At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.
 .
 After you've informed other maintainers, create a pull request to remove
 yourself from the MAINTAINERS file.
 .
 #### Inactive maintainer policy
 .
 An existing maintainer can be removed if they do not show significant activity
 on the project. Periodically, the maintainers review the list of maintainers
 and their activity over the last three months.
 .
 If a maintainer has shown insufficient activity over this period, a project
 representative will contact the maintainer to ask if they want to continue
 being a maintainer. If the maintainer decides to step down as a maintainer,
 they open a pull request to be removed from the MAINTAINERS file.
 .
 If the maintainer wants to continue in this role, but is unable to perform the
 required duties, they can be removed with a vote by at least 66% of the current
 maintainers. The maintainer under discussion will not be allowed to vote. An
 e-mail is sent to the mailing list, inviting maintainers of the project to
 vote. The voting period is five business days. Issues related to a maintainer's
 performance should be discussed with them among the other maintainers so that
 they are not surprised by a pull request removing them. This discussion should
 be handled objectively with no ad hominem attacks.
 .
 ## Project decision making
 .
 Short answer: **Everything is a pull request**.
 .
 The Moby core engine project is an open-source project with an open design
 philosophy. This means that the repository is the source of truth for **every**
 aspect of the project, including its philosophy, design, road map, and APIs.
 *If it's part of the project, it's in the repo. If it's in the repo, it's part
 of the project.*
 .
 As a result, each decision can be expressed as a change to the repository. An
 implementation change is expressed as a change to the source code. An API
 change is a change to the API specification. A philosophy change is a change
 to the philosophy manifesto, and so on.
 .
 All decisions affecting the moby/moby repository, both big and small, follow
 the same steps:
 .
 * **Step 1**: Open a pull request. Anyone can do this.
 .
 * **Step 2**: Discuss the pull request. Anyone can do this.
 .
 * **Step 3**: Maintainers merge, close or reject the pull request.
 .
 Pull requests are reviewed by the current maintainers of the moby/moby
 repository. Weekly meetings are organized to are organized to synchronously
 discuss tricky PRs, as well as design and architecture decisions.. When
 technical agreement cannot be reached among the maintainers of the project,
 escalation or concerns can be raised by opening an issue to be handled
 by the [Moby Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/moby/tsc).

 Package ssh implements an SSH client and server.
 .
 SSH is a transport security protocol, an authentication protocol and a
 family of application protocols. The most typical application level
 protocol is a remote shell and this is specifically implemented.  However,
 the multiplexed nature of SSH is exposed to users that wish to support
 others.

 Package gogoproto provides extensions for protocol buffers to achieve:
 .
 - fast marshalling and unmarshalling.
 - peace of mind by optionally generating test and benchmark code.
 - more canonical Go structures.
 - less typing by optionally generating extra helper code.
 - goprotobuf compatibility
 .
 More Canonical Go Structures
 .
 A lot of time working with a goprotobuf struct will lead you to a place where you create another struct that is easier to work with and then have a function to copy the values between the two structs.
 You might also find that basic structs that started their life as part of an API need to be sent over the wire. With gob, you could just send it. With goprotobuf, you need to make a parallel struct.
 Gogoprotobuf tries to fix these problems with the nullable, embed, customtype and customname field extensions.
 .
 - nullable, if false, a field is generated without a pointer (see warning below).
 - embed, if true, the field is generated as an embedded field.
 - customtype, It works with the Marshal and Unmarshal methods, to allow you to have your own types in your struct, but marshal to bytes. For example, custom.Uuid or custom.Fixed128
 - customname (beta), Changes the generated fieldname. This is especially useful when generated methods conflict with fieldnames.
 - casttype (beta), Changes the generated fieldtype.  All generated code assumes that this type is castable to the protocol buffer field type.  It does not work for structs or enums.
 - castkey (beta), Changes the generated fieldtype for a map key.  All generated code assumes that this type is castable to the protocol buffer field type.  Only supported on maps.
 - castvalue (beta), Changes the generated fieldtype for a map value.  All generated code assumes that this type is castable to the protocol buffer field type.  Only supported on maps.

 Package jsonpb provides marshaling and unmarshaling between protocol buffers and JSON.
 It follows the specification at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json.
 .
 This package produces a different output than the standard "encoding/json" package,
 which does not operate correctly on protocol buffers.

 Wrappers for primitive (non-message) types. These types are useful
 for embedding primitives in the `google.protobuf.Any` type and for places
 where we need to distinguish between the absence of a primitive
 typed field and its default value.
 .
 These wrappers have no meaningful use within repeated fields as they lack
 the ability to detect presence on individual elements.
 These wrappers have no meaningful use within a map or a oneof since
 individual entries of a map or fields of a oneof can already detect presence.

       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 .
       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 .
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:
 .
       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and
 .
       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and
 .
       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.
 .
       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.
 .
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
