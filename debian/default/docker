# Here in Debian, this file is sourced by:
#   - /etc/init.d/docker (sysvinit)
#   - /etc/init/docker (upstart)
#   - systemd's docker.service

# Use of this file for configuring your Docker daemon is discouraged.

# The recommended alternative is "/etc/docker/daemon.json", as described in:
#   https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/reference/commandline/daemon/#daemon-configuration-file

# If that does not suit your needs, try a systemd drop-in file, as described in:
#   https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/admin/systemd/#custom-docker-daemon-options
